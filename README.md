# Evaluation of short-read sequencing performance across the Mtb genome

This repository contains the analysis pipeline and coded needed to reproduce the analysis for [*Genomic sequence characteristics and the empiric accuracy of short-read sequencing, 2021*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.08.438862v1). All key bioinformatics processing is implemented using the [SnakeMake](https://snakemake.github.io/) workflow language with software dependencies defined for all steps using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).
